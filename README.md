# ICAAS website

The website of ICAAS, the International Conference on Autonomous AI Systems. It is written in Go using only the standard library. The page structure follows the IEEE ISCAS 2026 and 2027 sites.

## Run

Requires Go 1.21 or later.

```bash
go run . -dev                # http://localhost:8090; templates and content reload on every request
go build -o icas . && ./icas # single binary: templates, assets and content are embedded
```

| Flag / env | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-addr` / `ICAS_ADDR` or `PORT` | Listen address (default `:8090`) |
| `-data` / `ICAS_DATA_DIR` | Where submissions, uploaded papers, messages and subscribers are stored (default `data/`, see [Stored data](#stored-data)) |
| `-base-url` / `ICAS_BASE_URL` | Public origin for canonical links and `sitemap.xml` |
| `-trust-proxy` / `ICAS_TRUST_PROXY=1` | Honour `X-Forwarded-*` headers when running behind a reverse proxy |
| `ICAS_ADMIN_USER`, `ICAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Turn on `/admin`, which lists records and offers CSV exports (including an anonymized export for double-blind review), each paper as a PDF and all papers as one ZIP |

## Test

```bash
gofmt -l .
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```

The tests render every page, follow every internal link and asset, and exercise the submission, contact, newsletter and admin flows. GitHub Actions runs the same checks on every push and pull request.

## Project layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | Command-line entry point; embeds `web/` and `content/site.json` |
| `internal/server` | HTTP handlers, page registry and navigation, forms, admin, middleware |
| `internal/content` | Data model and validation for `content/site.json` |
| `internal/store` | JSON Lines storage for form records |
| `content/site.json` | All conference facts shown on the site |
| `web/templates` | HTML templates (layout, partials, one file per page) |
| `web/static` | CSS, JavaScript, images and downloadable files |
| `tools/make_assets.py` | Generator for the promotional kit, CFP flyer, slide template, social preview image and the flyer preview on the home page |
| `tools/demodata` | Generator for made-up records to try the admin pages (see [Demo data](#demo-data)) |
| `deploy/` | systemd unit and example settings for Linux servers (see [Deploy on Linux](#deploy-on-linux)) |

## Stored data

Everything visitors send is kept in the data directory (`-data`, default `data/`). Git ignores it, so it is never pushed. On Linux and macOS it is created with owner-only permissions.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `submissions.jsonl` | One proposal per line: the proposal, the speaker details, the paper's original file name, size and SHA-256, and the sender's IP address and browser |
| `papers/<ID>.pdf` | The paper of each proposal, named after its submission ID (e.g. `ICAAS2027-W001.pdf`), so the file name reveals nothing about the authors |
| `contacts.jsonl` | Contact form messages |
| `subscribers.jsonl` | Newsletter sign-ups |

Papers must be PDF files of at most 10 MB (`maxPaperBytes` in `internal/server/papers.go`). Back up the whole directory regularly; on a container platform, put it on a persistent volume.

## Deploy on Linux

`deploy/icas.service` runs the site as a systemd service that starts at boot and restarts after a crash. It runs as the unprivileged `icas` user, stores its data in `/var/lib/icas` and reads its settings from `/etc/icas/icas.env`. Only the binary and the two files in `deploy/` have to be copied to the server.

Build a Linux binary (use `GOARCH=arm64` for ARM servers; in PowerShell, set `$env:GOOS` and `$env:GOARCH` first):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o icas .
```

On the server, from a directory holding the binary and `deploy/`, create the user and install the files:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin icas
sudo install -m 755 icas /usr/local/bin/icas
sudo install -m 644 deploy/icas.service /etc/systemd/system/icas.service
sudo install -D -m 600 deploy/icas.env.example /etc/icas/icas.env
```

Set the public URL and the admin password in `/etc/icas/icas.env`, then start the service and enable it at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now icas
```

The example settings listen on `127.0.0.1:8090` and trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers, for a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) that serves HTTPS on ports 80 and 443. The sandbox in the unit lets the server write only to `/var/lib/icas` and a private `/tmp`, and it cannot bind ports below 1024 itself.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Status | `systemctl status icas` |
| Logs | `journalctl -u icas -f` |
| Apply changed settings | `sudo systemctl restart icas` |
| Update | `sudo install -m 755 icas /usr/local/bin/icas && sudo systemctl restart icas` |
| Stop starting at boot | `sudo systemctl disable --now icas` |

## Demo data

To try the admin pages without real submissions, fill a separate directory with made-up proposals (each with a PDF paper), contact messages and subscribers, then start the server on it with the admin pages turned on:

```bash
go run ./tools/demodata -data demo-data
ICAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=choose-a-password go run . -data demo-data -addr :8091
```

Everyone in the demo data is fictional. The generator refuses to write into a directory that already holds records, so it never mixes with real data. `demo-data/` is ignored by git; delete it to generate the data again.

## Editing content

All conference facts live in `content/site.json`. An empty string is shown on the site as **TBA**. This covers dates, venue, committee, keynotes, fees, sponsors, downloads, news and calls. Set `conference.submissionOpen` to `false` to close the submission form.

## Regenerating downloads

After you change the name, dates, venue or year, regenerate the promotional kit, the CFP flyer PDF and its home page preview, the slide template and the social preview image. File names follow the conference acronym (e.g. `ICAAS-CFP-flyer.pdf`). This needs Python with Pillow and python-pptx, and Edge or Chrome:

```bash
python tools/make_assets.py
```
